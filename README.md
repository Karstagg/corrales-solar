## Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice job on your Milestone 1! Your goals, persona and HTML all look good.

With your HTML, watch the placement of the tags and your indentation and spacing. The more exact you are with your HTML indentation the easier it will be the read and understand. I think I see a p tag that is opened but never closed, and those things are easier to notice when it all lines up. You also dont need the extra line spaces between the tags and the content. Here is an example: https://github.com/mjbovee/mjbovee-pwp/blob/master/public_html/documentation/milestone-1.html

Also watch your scope creep on this project, meaning the amount of features you hope to implement by the time the program is over. Refer to past PWPs for guidance on how big the site should or shouldn't be - you can still make the website for this company, but things like complex reviews and long lists of prices and details may be best saved for a later iteration of the site. For now I would focus on the design of the information/images (without getting hung up on creating content), and a really strong contact form.

In your .gitignore: You don't need a slash before .DS_Store because it's a file, not a directory. :)

All that said, you definitely hit the mark for the assignment and overall did a great job on putting together a persona that matches your goals. Edit: Since your submission was early as well, your milestone passes at a Tier IV!
